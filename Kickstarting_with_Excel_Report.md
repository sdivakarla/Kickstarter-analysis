# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project
The purpose of this project to assist a client in determining the best conditions for a favorable fundraising campaign. 

### Purpose
Our client, Louise, wants to fund kickstarter event for her play, Fever with an estimated budget of $10,000. She is seeking advice in order to run a successful campaign. We have determined that a review of previous kickstarter events may provide insight.  Data of a variety of campaigns can be reviewed and analyzed to suggest the best way to run a successful campaign. Then, Louise may be able to use that information to set up her campaign. 


## Analysis and Challenges
A dataset of 4,115 campaigns were analyzed to look for trends that may have impacted performance.  The campaigns were classified based on multiple parameters, including: amount of goal, amount pledged, outcome, date started, date completed, category of event, country located, and the number of backers. 

Analysis was performed using Excel. 
For a visual inspection of the large dataset, the column for Outcomes was conditional formatted to show different colors for "successful", "failed", "canceled" and "live".  The color output provides an ability to quickly scan large datasets to see if any trends are obvious. 

A column was added to calculate **percentage funded**, using the formula: '=ROUND(E2/D2*100,0)', where E was the amount pledged and D was the amount of the goal.  Understanding the 

 

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date

Starting and ending dates of each campaign was provided.  The dates for the theater campaigns were graphed based on the starting month of the campaign to look for trends.  The ![Graph of Theater Launch Dates] (https://github.com/sdivakarla/Kickstarter-analysis/blob/main/Theater_Outcome_VS_Launch.png) shows distinctive trends in the success of the campaigns.  Those campaigns started in April through July had a much higher success rate than those campaigns started in September through December. 



### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered

## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?

- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?

- What are some limitations of this dataset?

- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
